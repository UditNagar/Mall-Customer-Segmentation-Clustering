# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Clustering
Detecting Segmentation patterns in a Mall Customer Dataset using K-Means and Model Based Clustering


Mall Customer Segmentation Pattern Study
Our main aim is to identify the Mall Customer Segmentation patterns. By looking at the data we can assume that, how every customer needs to be specifically marketed to their different requirements. Companies can actually use this data to enhance their marketing techniques by understanding the preferences of every customer and use that to enhance their profits on the longer run

To perform segmentation for this data we need to explore the data we have i.e. Mall Customers. By the looks of it, we have individual unique customer IDs, A categorical variable in the form of Gender and three columns of Age, Annual Income and Spending Score which will be our main targets to identify the patterns in the customers' shopping and spending spree

Below I have performed the following tasks:

- Exploratory Data Analysis 
  - Data Description 
  - Characteristic Relation
- K-Means Clustering
- Model Based Clustering
